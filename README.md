In this project, I will secure an ASP.NET Core Web API application using JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication and authorization. Authentication will validate user credentials, while authorization will control access to different application functionalities based on user privileges. User credentials will be stored in a SQL Server database, utilizing Entity Framework and Identity Framework for database operations. JWT, an open standard (RFC 7519), provides a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. JWTs, which consist of a header, payload, and signature, can be signed using either a secret (HMAC) or a public/private key pair (RSA or ECDSA). This implementation will ensure that only authenticated users can access the API and perform authorized actions.
